// lib/inbox.mjs: issue #35 (spec revision 18). The commitment log is one append-only chain that is
// never merged, so a clone that was not doing the open commitment's work could not capture an item
// without racing the clone that was: the first push won, and the repair for the other side dropped
// its records. Each clone therefore owns an inbox, refs/sudus/inbox/<clone id>, a chain of item
// records only that clone appends to, so its push always fast-forwards. While a commitment is open,
// an item captured on any clone but the one that started it goes to that clone's inbox. After
// Done, `sudus fold` appends each inbox item to the log as an ordinary item record, so promotion,
// retirement and every other item rule work on it unchanged.
